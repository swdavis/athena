Regression checks for polarized transport, driven through mc_poltest.

mc_poltest launches a single photon with an exactly specified polarization state and
reports POLRESID: the largest departure of its coherency tensor, projected onto the
globally covariantly constant frame, from the value the problem generator seeded.  The
spacetime is flat, so the exact answer is zero and everything left is numerical.

This complements tst/montecarlo/snake_polarization, which refines the same quantity over a
free-free photon population.  Here the initial state is deterministic and known, which
makes the test sensitive to two things the population test cannot separate:

  order      GeneralPusher::AdvanceStep transports the tensor with Heun's method, so
             POLRESID must fall as stepsize**2.  It fell as stepsize**1 when the connection
             was evaluated only after the step.

  emission   The reference is taken from the tensor the problem generator seeds, before
             TransferPhotonsOnBlock rebuilds it from the handed-over Stokes parameters.  A
             rebuild that references the polarization to the wrong basis -- what happens if
             the coherency tensor is built after k has been transformed to the coordinate
             frame, or if a generator's own tensor is overwritten -- leaves a constant
             O(g_xy) offset that no amount of refinement removes, so the order checks read
             0 rather than 2.  Both bugs were reintroduced deliberately to confirm this
             test reports them; the first-order transport reads 1.

Note that the order checks, not the unsheared one, are what catch a bad emission basis.
With snake_a = 0 the coordinate and comoving frames coincide, so the ordering inside the
conversion makes no difference and the unsheared run passes either way.  What it does
pin down is the handover round trip in isolation, with no transport error on top of it.

Requires a build configured for this problem generator:

    python configure.py --prob=mc_poltest --coord=gr_user -g -mc && make
