//! \file photon_frames.hpp
//! \brief the frames a photon can be expressed in, and the projection into them.
//!
//! This is the layer that applies the geometric primitives of tetrad.hpp to Monte Carlo
//! quantities.  Nothing in tetrad.hpp knows about photons or mesh blocks; everything here
//! does.  Implemented in photon_frames.cpp.
//!
//! MCFrame and PhotonFrameState are part of the user-facing interface: a user moment
//! function declares the frame it wants at enrollment and receives a PhotonFrameState
//! already projected into it.  PhotonFrames itself is internal -- UpdateMoments builds one
//! per call and the caching is what keeps several user moments sharing a frame down to a
//! single projection.

#include <cmath>    // isnan, isinf

// Athena++ headers

//! \brief the frames radiation moments can be reported in.
//!
//! MCFRAME_LAB and MCFRAME_COMOVING are orthonormal: in general relativity they are the
//! tetrads of the normal (Eulerian) observer and of the frame vel is built on, and in flat
//! spacetime they are the Eulerian frame and its Lorentz boost.  MCFRAME_COORD is the raw
//! coordinate basis, which is not orthonormal -- its components are dimensionally
//! inhomogeneous by construction, which is what makes them the right form to hand to the
//! GRMHD conservative variables.

//! \struct PhotonFrameState
//! \brief a photon's energy, propagation direction and path length in one frame
//!
//! dl belongs here rather than being passed alongside: the pushers hand UpdateMoments a
//! coordinate path length, and the length in any other frame differs by that frame's
//! energy over ep.  Handing a caller a frame-correct energy next to a coordinate dl moves
//! that trap rather than removing it.  n is a unit vector in the orthonormal frames; in
//! MCFRAME_COORD it holds k^i/k^0 and is not normalised.

//! other consumer wanting comoving quantities had to reimplement the tetrad projection.
//! Every frame bug found in this code came from exactly that: a convention reimplemented
//! somewhere new.  Caching per call also means a run with several comoving user moments
//! pays for one projection rather than one per function.
